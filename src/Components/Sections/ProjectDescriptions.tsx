    "I enrolled in a Computer Science B.S. program at Metropolitan State University. I completed 35 credits (A little over an associates level) before switching my focus to my first contract to update a website for a business. The client had a website made from a website builder in the early 2000’s and it was out of date. The client wanted a modern site with specific features that fit their vision. After just a few design and feature changes of my prototype the client was satisfied with the look, functionality, and performance of the web solution. This solution can be viewed in the projects section. I have also completed a freelance contract with an upcoming caster business. (NDA Contract)",
  actualAbout:
    "While I have a genuine passion for technology and programming and that is the focus of this portfolio, I also have other interests! A few of my other hobbies: video games, cars, and guitar. I'll elaborate a little bit for each hobby, for video games I don’t play much anymore but when I do I’m typically on: Overwatch, Minecraft, Red Dead Redemption, or Bloons Tower Defense. If I had to pick a dream car for gas and electric they would be a CT5-V Blackwing for the gas and a Tesla Model S Plaid for the electric. For guitar I don’t have much of a collection but I enjoy playing what I have. I typically do a good mix of strum and picking but spend more time practicing picking.",
